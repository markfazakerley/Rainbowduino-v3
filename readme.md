---------------

This is a support library for Seeed Studio's Rainbowduino V3 LED driver 
board.  This can be purchased as part of their [Rainbow Cube Kit][] or 
[on its own][Rainbowduino V3].

SeeedStudio maintains a wiki about these development boards at
<http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Rainbow_Cube> and
<http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Rainbowduino_v3.0>.

The version in this GitHub repo differs from the ZIP file in that it's been
made compatible with the Arduino 1.0 environment.  The use of WProgram.h was
changed to be Arduino.h and the sketches were renamed to have the .ino 
extension.

Seeed released this code under the LGPL v.2.1 so you can use it with your own
sketches as long as you provide a way for users to relink your sketch
with an updated version of this library.
